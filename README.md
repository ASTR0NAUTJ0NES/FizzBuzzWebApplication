# FizzBuzzWebApplication

The Fizzbuzz coding challenge was invented in 2007 by Imran Ghoryin in order to assess developer competence. Since its conception the Fizzbuzz challenge has been used by Facebook and Microsoft as interview tools and has also been taught at Stanford, Berkley, Caltech and countless other universities.

This program will allow you to enter two numbers in. It will then display numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of the first number, “Fizz” will display instead of the number and for the multiples of the second number, “Buzz” will display. For numbers which are multiples of both the first and second number, “FizzBuzz” will display.
