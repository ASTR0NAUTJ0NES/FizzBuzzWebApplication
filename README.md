# FizzBuzzWebApplication
 This program will allow you to enter two numbers in. It will then display numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of the first number, “Fizz” will display instead of the number and for the multiples of the second number, “Buzz” will display. For numbers which are multiples of both the first and second number, “FizzBuzz” will display.
